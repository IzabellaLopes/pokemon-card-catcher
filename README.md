### Accessibility

I have been attentive to make the website as accessible-friendly as possible through the following measures:

* Utilizing semantic HTML to provide meaningful structure and enhance accessibility.
* Incorporating descriptive alt attributes for images on the site to provide alternative text for screen readers.
* Ensuring an adequate color contrast across the site to improve readability for users with visual impairments. I employed the contrast checker provided by [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to validate the contrast ratio between the selected foreground color and background color.

By implementing these considerations, I have strived to enhance the overall accessibility of the website.
