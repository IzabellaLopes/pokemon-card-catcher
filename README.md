Welcome to Pokémon Card Catcher, the ultimate memory card game that will put your memory skills to the test! Whether you're a seasoned Pokémon fan or just looking for a fun and challenging game, this is the perfect choice for you.

Pokémon Card Catcher was developed for players of all ages who enjoy testing their memory and concentration abilities while immersed in the colorful world of Pokémon. The game's concept is simple but addictive: find matching pairs of Pokémon cards as quickly as possible.

One unique aspect of Pokémon Card Catcher is that the captivating images of the Pokémon were drawn by my talented children. Their artwork adds a personal touch to the game, making it even more special and enjoyable for players of all ages.

## Design

### Color Scheme

The color palette for the creation of the memory game "Pokémon Card Catcher" was carefully chosen to enhance the overall gaming experience and evoke a sense of nostalgia and excitement.

In my CSS file, I employed variables to define colors and consistently applied them across the entire stylesheet. It enables easy color updates throughout the website by modifying the color once in the variable, maintaining consistency across the design.

The following color codes were selected:

- Blue (#3466AF) and Yellow (#FFCB05) for Card Catcher header to match the Pokémon logo.

- As the site features a Pokémon landscape background image, I included a calming and soothing hue of Aliceblue (#F0F8FF) for a visually appealing backdrop, reducing eye strain during extended play. For the foreground color, I opted for a darker blue (#1E3B66) that provides excellent contrast, confirmed through the WebAIM Contrast Checker.

- Additionally, for icons and certain details, I selected shades of red, Firebrick (#B22222) and Dark Red (#64201C), reminiscent of the Pokéball, adding an element of excitement and intensity to the game.

The color palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

- [Luckiest Guy](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Luckiest+Guy?preview.text=P%C3%B3kemon%20Card%20Catcher&preview.text_type=custom&query=Luckiest+Guy) for Header:

  - Clean and elegant design, that provides pleasant reading experience
  - Friendly and rounded letterforms complement the playful nature of the game, creating a visually appealng and enjoyable experience for the players

### Imagery

The images were sourced from free downloads from PNGEGG, PNGWING, WALLPAPER SAFARI, IMGUR, FLATICON, as well as personally handcrafted by my talented children, Thiago Carvalho, 7 years old, and Júlia Carvalho, 6 years old.

### Accessibility

I have been attentive to make the website as accessible-friendly as possible through the following measures:

- Utilizing semantic HTML to provide meaningful structure and enhance accessibility.
- Incorporating descriptive alt attributes for images on the site to provide alternative text for screen readers.
- Ensuring an adequate color contrast across the site to improve readability for users with visual impairments. I employed the contrast checker provided by [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to validate the contrast ratio between the selected foreground color and background color.

By implementing these considerations, I have strived to enhance the overall accessibility of the website.
