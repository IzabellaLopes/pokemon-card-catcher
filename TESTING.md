Throughout the entire build, I conducted continuous testing. While working on the project, I relied on Chrome Developer Tools to precisely identify and address any issues that arose.

During the development process, I extensively utilized Google Developer Tools to verify the proper functioning of elements and to effectively troubleshoot when things didn't go as planned.

For JavaScript, I made use of the console in Developer Tools to carefully inspect small sections of code and ensure its smooth execution. Additionally, it proved invaluable in pinpointing and resolving any problems encountered.

To guarantee responsiveness across various screen sizes and devices, I meticulously checked each page using Google Chrome Developer Tools. This ensured a seamless user experience across all platforms.
